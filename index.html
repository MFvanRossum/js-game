      <p>So you woke up and you're a square. Well, this isn't ideal.</p> 
      <p>But what's this? "Pew! Pew!"</p>
      You can fire lazers. How about that. 
      <p>And not a moment too soon. Here come some nasty rectangles.
      And they don't seem to like you. Best get after it!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="controls">
      <p>Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move.</p>
      <p> Fire your "pew-pew" lazer with SPACE. </p>
      If you die, don't worry about it! Just reload the page to try again!
